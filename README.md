Source for http://hal2016.haskell.org/
=====================================

This repository contains the source for http://hal2016.haskell.org/. Together
with travis and GitHub pages, this is set up so that every commit is
automatically deployed.

So if you want to change something on the webpage, e.g. a typo in your name,
the abstract of your talk or similar, simply click [edit] and create a pull
request.

How much more convenient for everyone than sending around mails!

Contact Joachim Breitner <breitner@kit.edu> in case of questions.
