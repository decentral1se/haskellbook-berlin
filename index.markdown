title: Berlin Haskell Reading Group
---
We're a group based in Berlin motivated to learn the [Haskell] programming
language. Initially proposed by [Adel], we plan to use the newly released
[Haskell Programming from first principles] as our learning material. The
authors come highly recommended, please visit [Chris Allen's blog] and [Julie
Moronuki's blog] for more information.

The authors of the book have kindly offered to give us a 50% discount on the
price of the book. In order to decide if you want to make the purchase, please
review [the official sample]. Please contact [Adel] if you'd like a copy of the
book then.

Join Us
--------
Please introduce yourself via the [the meetup group]. Any skill level is
welcome and you can join whenever you want. Please do attend, even when you
didn't get the material covered. We can all still learn something from each
other. If you are feeling social, we are officially using the `#BerlinHaskell`
handle on Twitter.

Guidelines
----
The basic idea is as follows:

  * Secure a location and meet every 2 weeks
  * Find a willing Haskell mentor to help face to face
  * Propose a work load for the following meeting
  * Use [our Github issues] to get help between meetings

Note the following:

  * As a fairly loose group, these guidelines may change.
  * There is no official organizer for this group. It's up to us!

When helping another person to solve a problem, please do the following:

  * Don't simply reveal the answer to the problem, lead the person to it.
  * Be helpful and try to cite sources or page numbers that can help the person.
