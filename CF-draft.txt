== About HaL ==

The workshop series “Haskell in Leipzig”, now in its 11th year, brings together
Haskell developers, Haskell users, Haskell researchers, Haskell enthusiasts and
Haskell beginners to listen to talks, take part in tutorials and join in
interesting conversations.

Everything Haskellish is on topic, whether it is on current research, practical
application of Haskell, interesting ideas off the beaten track, education,
artistic uses, and may extend to functional programming and its connections
into other paradigms as well.

This year, HaL is colocated with two related conferences,
 * the Workshop on Functional and (Constraint) Logic Programming (WFLP) and
 * the Workshop on (Constraint) Logic Programming (WLP),
to form the Leipzig Week of Declarative Programming (L-DEC):

In order to accommodate this more international audience, this year’s HaL will
be in English.

== Submissions ==

Contributions can take the form of

 * talks (about 30 minutes),
 * tutorials (about 30 minutes),
 * demonstration, artistic performance, other crazy ideas.

Please submit an abstract that describes the content and form of your
presentation, the intended audience and required previous knowledge.
We recommend a length of 2 pages, so that the PC and the audience gets a good
idea of your submission, but this is not a hard requirement.

Please submit your abstract, as an PDF document, at
